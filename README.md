## Introduction

Point clouds are a fundamental data format used in various computer vision and 3D perception tasks. This repository is aimed at helping you process, classify, and segment point cloud data using Open3D, ModelNet10 dataset, and the PointNet network.

## Dependencies

Before using the code in this repository, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- [Open3D](http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/getting_started.html)
- [ModelNet10 Dataset](http://modelnet.cs.princeton.edu/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

## Usage

**Download the ModelNet10 dataset and preprocess it:**

To get started, follow these steps to download the ModelNet10 dataset and prepare it for your project:

1. [Download the ModelNet10 dataset](http://modelnet.cs.princeton.edu/). You may need to register or accept their terms and conditions.

2. Once downloaded, extract the dataset files to a directory of your choice.

3. Preprocess the dataset if necessary. This may include data normalization, format conversion, or other steps specific to your project. Document these preprocessing steps to make the dataset ready for your code.

**Run the point cloud processing code:**

To process point clouds, follow these instructions:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/point-cloud-processing.git
   cd point-cloud-processing
